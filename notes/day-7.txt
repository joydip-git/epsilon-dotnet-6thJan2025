exception handling:
	errors in app:
	1. compile-time error: compiler will detect those errors.
	2. runtime error: 
		caused by some code, which runtime can't execute.
		ex: divide a number by zero, access value from an invalid index position in array etc.
		runtime stops execution of your code
		runtime itself creates object of an built-in class, Exception.
		populates that class object with information, such as, in which line the error occurred in which class, in which file of which application etc.
		and then runtime passes (throws) the reference of that Exception class object in your code.
		you should provide facility to accept (catch) that Exception object reference in order to get full details abou what went wrong in the application.

	"handle" exception using "try...catch" block.
	try block -> write actual code inside with possibility fo exception
	catch block -> to catch exception
	finally block -> makes sure that the code written inside is always executed, irrespective of the exception. it is used to clear/close resources (such as: database connecion closing, file connection closing etc.)

	Note:
	One try block can have multiple catch blocks
	in case of multiple catch blocks, the catch block with top-level base class Exception should be that last one.
	Because this is the catch block iwth super class Exception and being the base class for every other exeption classes, it can hold reference of any child exception class object.
	you can throw your own exception or rethrow already caught exception, by using "throw" keyword
	with one try block, ONLY ONE finally block is allowed.

Exception:
	private string _message;

	public Exception()
	public Exception(string error) { _message = error;}
	public Exception(string error, Exception inner)	
	
	public virtual string Message => _message;

ApplicationException:
	public Exception()
	public Exception(string error):base(error)
	public Exception(string error, Exception inner):base(error,inner)


DivisionArgumentException:
	public DivisionArgumentException()
	public DivisionArgumentException(string error):base(error)
	public DivisionArgumentException(string error, Exception inner):base(error,inner)
	
relationship between classes:
	is-a	: inheritance
	has-a	: association

association: 
	types based on cardinality and strength of relationship
	a. composition [1<->1, 1 <-> M]
	b. aggregation [ 1 <-> M]
	c. simple association [ M <->M ]

Composition:
----------------------
two entities are sharing composition relationship, wher one is composed of another as well as if one entity's lifecycle/existence depends on another completely

Room [1 Room -> 1 Building]
Building [1 Building -> Many Rooms]

existence of Room depends on existence Building

Aggregation:
----------------------
Desktop [1 Deskotop -> 1 RAM]
RAM [1 RAM -> 1 Desktop]

two entities are sharing aggregation relationship, where one is aggregation of another as well as if one entity's lifecycle/existence depends on another partially (not so tight like composition)

Simple Association:
------------------------------
Trainer [1 Trainer -> Many Trainee]
Trainee [1 Trainee -> Many Trainer]

two entities are sharing simple association relationship, where one is NOT composed or aggregation of another as well as if one entity's lifecycle/existence DOES NOT depend on another. It is the loosest relationship.


class C{}

class A
{
	private C cInstance;	
	public A(C cRef) { cInstance = cRef;}
	public C CInstance { set => cInstance = value; get => cInstance;}
}

C objC = new C();
A objA = new A(objC);

Optional arguments with default value:
	if you do not want to pass values for some parameters to a method, then you can declare those parameters in the method as optional argument by assigning some default values to them.
	Note: all optional arguments should be the last arguments in the method.
	
Nullable Type:
-------------------------------
situation
int id = <id-of-a-product-from-db>;
int cid = <cid(nullable)-of-a-product-from-db>;
int data type is value type, hence can't store null.

nullable type: allows the type to store a NULL value or a value of a specific value type.

Nullable<int> cid = null;
cid = 1;

//short-hand
int? cid = null;
cid = 1;

Null Check for reference type:
-----------------------------------
string? name = Console.ReadLine();
console.writeline(name?.ToLower());

Null-coalesce operator:
-------------------------------
??
