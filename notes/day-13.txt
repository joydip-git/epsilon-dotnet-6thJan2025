web applications:

web page: 	  HTML
web page styling: CSS
web page code:    JavaScript

Web Server: host for web apps
production web servers: 
	a. Internet Information Services (IIS)
	b. Apache Tomcat
	c. NGINX
	d. Vercel
	etc.

development-mode web server or application development server:
	hosts a particular web app during development
	it uses port number different from 80
	many, such as, Live Server, IIS Express etc.

Live Server: can added as plugin in VS Code
Hot Module Replacement: during development many app server offers facility to load the latest version of the application content in the browser by replacing the older version. (HMR)

script tag => 
		
	to write JS code inside HTML file
	to connect/link a JS file with HTML file using its "src" attribute

CSS:
	background-color:'blue'
	font-size:bold
	color:

	css-property-name:value

	a. in-line styling [using "style" attribute of any element]

	b. out-line styling 
		i. using "style" tag of HTML, written inside either head of body element or both
		ii. using separate CSS file and connecting the CSS file with HTML file by "link" tag
		note: link tag can be used NOT ONLY to link css files, but other types of files too

	1. Element selector
		element-name1, element-name2,... { set of styles }
	2. id selector
		#id-of-element1, #id-of-element2,...{ set of styles }
	in these two cases, you have to plan/decide the elements on which the set of styles to be applied, before you start creating those set of styles

	if you just want to create a set of styles, without deciding/mentioning the names of elements of ids of elements from the beginning, you can use
	3. class selector
		.class-name { set of styles }
	now use "class" attribute of any HTML element to mention the name of the css class

	note: 
		an element can apply more than one css class. 
		while mentioning multiple CSS class names, use a single space to separate them


HTML:
--------------
tags -> self-closing tag/empty tag
meta tag 
	charset attribute -> which type of encoding format is used to encode HTML file

design related elements/tags
	=> block element
	=> inline element


JS issues:
----------------------------
its is loosely typed language, i.e. a variable can store any value at any point of time
limited number of data types
there is no static type checking
there is no strict data typing
this is Object-based, NOT object-oriented programming language
note: OOP like featurs are present through prototype-based programming

Server-side framework:
------------------------------
Microsoft
	COM framework =>  ASP (Active Server Pages) => *.asp
	.net framework => ASP.NET (C#) => *.aspx/*.aspx.cs

	the aspx page request is processed by a dll [used by web server] => ISAPI dll

Sun Microsystem:
	JSP-Servlet: Java => *.jsp

.NET 
	ASP.NET Core to create web applications
	a. web page applications
	b. MVC architecture based web page application
	c. RESTful API application (ASP.NET Core Web API)
	etc.



Razor App 	Blazor App 	ASP.NET Core MVC  	ASP.NET Core Web API
			ASP.NET Core Web App

any ASP.NET Core application looks like a console application and runs like a desktop based app
	web host
	built-in web server
	....

then depending on further configuration they can behave accordingly

Model-View-Controller
	View => web design
	Controller => module which connects Model and View
	Model => write business/data-acces logic

https://localhost:5005/ => default url

https://localhost:5005/home/index
https://localhost:5005/home/hello/joydip

controller => home
action => index
