create an console application to calulate salary of employees

1. create a library application to create Employee class
employee	
	data: name, id, basicpay, dapay, hrapay, totalpay
	method: to calculate the total salary (add the basic, da and hra)
		args: None
		return: void
	constructors: default and parameterized
	properties: for all the members

	Note: 
	a. the "id" should be set only once [id is readonly]
	b. the "totalpay", should not be allowed to be set from outside the class scope. it will set only by the method to calulate total payment.

2. Create the client (console) application (in the same solution).
3. Add reference os the libray application with employee class code, from the client application.

3. in the Main method of the client app:
a. create an object of employee class
b. accept all the values from user
c. print the total pay of the employee along with the name of that employee

ex: Total Salary of Sunil is 10000

Note: try to use logic segregation through multiple classes
