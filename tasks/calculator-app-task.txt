create a console app for some calculation:

	4 static mehods in Program class apart from Main method
	- Add
	- Subtract
	- Multiply
	- Divide

	all 4 methods accepts two arguents (parameters).
	data type: int (both)

	all 4 methods must calculate and the return the resultant
	return type: int

	call those 4 methods from user (one by one)
	accept parameters to be passed to those methods from user
	print the results

enhancement:
	print a menu for user
	accept a choice from user
	based on the choice invoke a method

	the application should run at least once and perform at least one operation. then ask user whether to continue further or not. based on the choice either the application will continue running or terminate.
